Refined Implementation Plan
Here is the upgraded roadmap. I have bolded the additions to your original list.

Phase 1: Infrastructure & Auth
[ ] Init Next.js + Tailwind + Lucide.

[ ] Setup Vercel Postgres (Primary DB).

[ ] Setup Vercel KV (Cache/Live Feed).

[ ] Configure NextAuth.js (Google Provider).

Phase 2: The "Gym State" (Core Data)
[ ] Define Walls constants (static data).

[ ] Create Routes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Logic: When a route is created in Postgres, push a simplified version to a Vercel KV list for fast homepage loading.

[ ] Build "Grade Distribution" Visualization for Setters.

Phase 3: The Social Layer
[ ] Route Page:

Fetch Route Details (Server Component).

Fetch Comments/Activity (Client Component/Suspense).

[ ] "Send" Logic:

User clicks "Flash" -> Writes to Postgres -> Updates "Ticks" count in KV (atomic increment).

[ ] Activity Feed: A global page showing "Recent sends by the community."

Phase 4: Advanced UI/UX
[ ] Optimistic UI: When a user comments, show it immediately (via React useOptimistic) before the server responds.

[ ] Skeleton Loading: Climbing gyms often have bad reception. Use Skeletons heavily while data fetches.

[ ] PWA Manifest: Add manifest.json so users can install it to their home screen like a native app.
